  # Project Essentials

  ## Project Identity
  @qi/dp-actor v0.1.0 - TypeScript market data DSL with FIX Protocol 4.4 compliance

  ## @qi Usage Patterns
  Reference implementation guides:
  • `docs/qicore/usage/qi-base-usage.md` - @qi/base Result handling patterns
  • `docs/qicore/usage/qi-core-usage.md` - @qi/core integration patterns

  ## User Quality Standards
  • Essential facts only, no explanatory text
  • Structured bullet points without elaboration
  • Reference-manual format - state facts, skip discussion
  • Direct information transfer, not conversational responses

  ## Memory Protocol
  • Search memory before responding to any question
  • Use sequential thinking for substantive questions
  • Follow workflow: memory check → docs review → task status
