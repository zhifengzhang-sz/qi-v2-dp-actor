# Implementation Guidelines - Future Considerations

This document captures implementation-level guidance that was suggested during DSL reviews but is intentionally kept **outside** the core DSL specification to maintain simplicity and proper separation of concerns.

## Core DSL Principle

> **The DSL defines the vocabulary (data types) and grammar (operations) of market data. Context, routing, and behavior are the responsibility of implementers.**

The suggestions below are **infrastructure and operational concerns** that should be addressed in implementation guides, not in the core DSL contracts.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Concerns (Future Implementation Guides)

### Subscription Resource Management
**Scope**: Implementation infrastructure  
**Why not in DSL**: Resource management is deployment-specific

```yaml
# Future implementation guide topic
subscription_management:
  max_concurrent_subscriptions: "implementer-defined based on system capacity"
  resource_cleanup: "automatic on connection loss"
  reconnection_behavior: "implementer-defined with exponential backoff recommended"
  memory_management: "subscription cleanup on client disconnect"
```

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Different deployment environments have different resource constraints
- Memory management strategies vary by language and runtime
- Connection pooling strategies are infrastructure-dependent

### Rate Limiting Patterns
**Scope**: Operational resilience  
**Why not in DSL**: Rate limiting is source-dependent and operational

```yaml
# Future implementation guide topic
rate_limiting_patterns:
  per_source: "respect source-specific limits (e.g., CoinGecko: 50 calls/min)"
  circuit_breaking: "recommended for external API resilience"
  backpressure: "required for streaming operations to prevent memory overflow"
  adaptive_throttling: "adjust rates based on error responses"
```

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Each data source has different rate limits
- Circuit breaker patterns depend on infrastructure choices
- Backpressure handling varies by streaming implementation

### Connection Health Monitoring
**Scope**: Infrastructure reliability  
**Why not in DSL**: Connection management is transport-specific

```yaml
# Future implementation guide topic
heartbeat_specification:
  interval: "implementer-defined (recommend 30s for WebSocket, 5s for TCP)"
  timeout: "3 missed heartbeats = connection considered dead"
  reconnection_strategy: "exponential backoff with jitter"
  health_check_endpoints: "/health for HTTP-based implementations"
```

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Different protocols (WebSocket, TCP, HTTP) have different heartbeat needs
- Network environments affect optimal timeout values
- Reconnection strategies depend on infrastructure architecture

## üîß Performance Optimization Concerns (Future Implementation Guides)

### Data Validation Timing
**Scope**: Performance optimization  
**Why not in DSL**: Validation strategy is implementation-specific

```yaml
# Future implementation guide topic
validation_timing:
  read_operations: "validate context before external calls to fail fast"
  write_operations: "validate both context and data before I/O operations"
  streaming: "validate on subscription creation, trust data during stream"
  caching: "validate once, cache validation results for repeated operations"
```

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Early validation reduces external API calls
- Streaming validation trade-offs between safety and performance
- Caching strategies depend on data volatility

### Message Ordering Guarantees
**Scope**: Implementation behavior  
**Why not in DSL**: Ordering depends on transport and infrastructure

```yaml
# Future implementation guide topic
ordering_guarantees:
  within_symbol: "messages ordered per symbol when using single connection"
  across_symbols: "no ordering guarantee across different symbols"
  timestamp_ordering: "best effort based on source timestamps, not guaranteed"
  sequence_numbers: "use sequence numbers for gap detection if required"
```

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Ordering guarantees depend on transport layer (TCP vs UDP vs HTTP)
- Single vs. multiple connection strategies affect ordering
- Different data sources provide different ordering guarantees

## üìã Streaming Implementation Patterns (Future Implementation Guides)

### Streaming Examples and Patterns
**Scope**: Implementation patterns  
**Why not in DSL**: Specific to implementation technology choices

```yaml
# Future implementation guide topic
streaming_patterns:
  subscription_lifecycle:
    - "subscribe ‚Üí receive updates ‚Üí unsubscribe"
    - "automatic reconnection on disconnect with state recovery"
    - "graceful degradation on partial connection loss"
  
  writing_streams:
    - "start stream ‚Üí write multiple ‚Üí stop with proper cleanup"
    - "buffering for high throughput scenarios"
    - "batch writing for efficiency"
  
  error_handling:
    - "retry failed writes with exponential backoff"
    - "dead letter queues for persistently failed messages"
    - "circuit breakers for downstream service protection"
```

**Implementation Considerations**:
- WebSocket vs. Server-Sent Events vs. gRPC streaming have different patterns
- Buffering strategies depend on memory constraints and latency requirements
- Error recovery patterns depend on business requirements

## üéØ Future Documentation Structure

### Core DSL (Current - Keep Simple)
- **Market data vocabulary**: Price, Level1, OHLCV, MarketDepth, etc.
- **Operation grammar**: read, write, stream interfaces
- **Error semantics**: Result<T> patterns
- **Standards compliance**: FIX Protocol mappings
- **Foundation requirements**: @qi/base, @qi/core dependencies

### Implementation Guides (Future - Detailed Guidance)
1. **Infrastructure Setup Guide**
   - Resource management patterns
   - Connection pooling strategies
   - Health monitoring implementation

2. **Performance Optimization Guide**
   - Validation timing strategies
   - Caching patterns
   - Batching optimizations

3. **Operational Resilience Guide**
   - Rate limiting implementations
   - Circuit breaker patterns
   - Error recovery strategies

4. **Streaming Implementation Guide**
   - Technology-specific patterns (WebSocket, gRPC, etc.)
   - Ordering and consistency guarantees
   - Subscription lifecycle management

## üèÜ Design Philosophy

### What Belongs in the DSL
- **Data contracts**: Structure and semantics of market data
- **Operation contracts**: Signatures and laws for operations
- **Error contracts**: How errors are represented and propagated
- **Standards compliance**: Industry protocol mappings (FIX)

### What Belongs in Implementation Guides
- **Infrastructure patterns**: Connection management, resource allocation
- **Performance strategies**: Optimization, caching, batching
- **Operational concerns**: Rate limiting, monitoring, alerting
- **Technology choices**: WebSocket vs. HTTP, database selection, etc.

This separation ensures the DSL remains **timeless and focused** while implementation guides can evolve with infrastructure trends and operational best practices.

## üìù Action Items for Future

1. **Create Implementation Guide Series**
   - Infrastructure setup and resource management
   - Performance optimization patterns
   - Operational resilience strategies
   - Technology-specific streaming guides

2. **Maintain DSL Simplicity**
   - Resist adding infrastructure concerns to core DSL
   - Keep DSL focused on market data vocabulary and operations
   - Maintain clear separation between contracts and implementation

3. **Community Feedback Integration**
   - Collect implementation experiences from users
   - Update implementation guides based on real-world usage
   - Keep core DSL stable while evolving implementation guidance

This approach ensures we have a **clean, focused DSL** while providing comprehensive guidance for real-world implementations.
